The chatbots currently being used are very domain-specific. Through the project, we try to create a general-purpose chatbot. We fine-tuned pre-trained a GPT-based architecture on PERSONA-CHAT dataset released by Facebook AI team in 2018. It is a crowd-sourced dataset consisting of 162,064 utterances collected from crowd workers working in Amazon Mechanical Turk. Several crowd-workers were paired randomly, and each group was asked to condition their conversations based on a given persona. We obtained perplexity of 16.28 and F1-score of 19.5. This project was done as part of my Bachelors Thesis under Dr. Pinaki Chakraborty, an associate professor at NSIT.
