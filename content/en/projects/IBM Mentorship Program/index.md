## IBM Global Remote Mentorship Program 

I was part of the team which undertook a project to improve the efficiency of neural architectures for comprehension-based question answering. Under the advisory of Dr. Kuntal Dey (Technology R&D Senior Principal at Accenture Technology, formerly (Advisory Research Scientist at IBM Research) and Seema Nagar (Advisory Research Scientist at IBM Research), we created a neural pipeline to translate the linguistically complex sentences of the Stanford Question-Answering dataset into simple sentences. We further performed an ablation study which confirmed that neural architecture performs better with simpler sentences in comprehension-based question answering tasks. It was published as a research paper titled “Text Simplification for Comprehension-based Question-Answering” in one of the workshops held at the World Wide Web Conference (WWW) 2021.
