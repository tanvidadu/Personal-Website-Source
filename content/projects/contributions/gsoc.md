description: "Created two new modules, the Feedback Sharing Module to provide a brief feedback of the images uploaded, and the Quiz module for users who have a high percentage of their uploads deleted. Both modules were included in the v2.8 release of the Wikimedia Commons App. They can currently be accessed by going to the Settings and opting in as a Beta Tester of these new features."
