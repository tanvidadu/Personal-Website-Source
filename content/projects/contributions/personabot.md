Chatbots are often used online and in messaging apps, but are also now included in many operating systems as intelligent virtual assistants, such as Siri for Apple products and Cortana for Windows. Dedicated chatbot appliances are also becoming increasingly common, such as Amazon's Alexa. These chatbots can perform a wide variety of functions based on user commands.
Non-goal-oriented dialogue systems (chatbots) are an interesting test-bed for interactive Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems and are also directly useful in a wide range of applications ranging from technical support services to entertainment. However, building intelligent conversational agents remains an unsolved problem in artificial intelligence research. Recently, recurrent neural network-based models with sufficient capacity and access to large datasets attracted a large interest when first attempted. Vinyals and Le (2015) showed that they were capable of generating meaningful responses in some chit-chat settings. Still, further inquiries in the capabilities of these neural network architectures and developments (Serban et al., 2016; Miao, Yu, and Blunsom, 2015; Sordoni et al., 2015; Serban et al., 2017; Li, Monroe, and Jurafsky, 2016; Li et al., 2017) indicated that they were limited which made communicating with them a rather unsatisfying experience for human beings.

The chatbots currently being used are very domain-specific. Through the project, we try to create a general-purpose chatbot.
