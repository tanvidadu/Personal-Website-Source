It’s a common practice among people to refer the internet or various easily accessible resources before they consult a doctor. This can often create a sense of panic and confusion if the sources are not reliable. In the case of skin diseases, where it might be very hard to describe the exact condition through verbal description, diagnosis through image recognition could be the future of skin disease detection. There already exist some applications which diagnose skin diseases through the textual description provided by the user. However, this very description can be questionable as the patient might accidentally distort the facts while providing the information. So, as tech enthusiasts, our teams believes that there’s a needs to devise a mechanism which will not be dependent only on the user’s textual description but rather, rely on factual information like images and videos.

This app incorporates image recognition to provide an accurate diagnosis of the skin disorder without any biases. This allows the users to narrow down the disease depending upon the images of the affected area. According to the disease detected, the app will provide some suggestion to prevent the disease from spreading further along with the contact of the nearest dermatologist that the patient can visit.
